          (Message) From the stack trace and the line that caused the segmentation fault
          (`int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;`), it seems like there's a null pointer
          dereference happening in this line of code. Let's dissect the structure to see
          where it could be coming from.

          From the MultiTool response, we have the struct definitions for `Adam`, `Bob`,
          `Charlie`, and `David`. However, it seems there was an error retrieving the
          `David` struct definition at the given location, so I suspect there might have
          been a typo or miscommunication with the tool about the symbol's existence at
          that location.

          But from the code given, we can guess the structure:

          ```cpp
          struct David
          {
              int* data;
          };

          struct Charlie
          {
              David* d1;
          };

          struct Bob
          {
              Charlie* c1;
              Charlie* c2;
              David* d2;
          };

          struct Adam
          {
              Bob* b1;
              Bob* b2;
          };
          ```

          From these definitions and the instance initialization in your code, we can make
          several observations:

          - `arrayofints` is an array of `int` presumably declared and defined somewhere -
          We cannot see a problem here without the actual complete code.
          - `David david5 = {nullptr};` - This suggests that `David`'s `data` member is a
          null pointer here.
          - `Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};` - `charlie4`'s `d1` is pointing to `David
          david5`, which has a `data` member that is a null pointer.
          - `Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6};` - `bob2`'s `c2` is pointing to
          `charlie4`.
          - `Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};` - `adam1`'s `b2` is pointing to `bob2`.

          When you try to access `int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;`, you're dereferencing
          through `bob2`'s `c2` (which is `charlie4`), which then tries to dereference
          `d1` (which is `david5`), and finally tries to dereference `data` (which is
          `nullptr`). The dereference of a null pointer is the cause of the SIGSEGV
          (segmentation fault).

          To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that you do not attempt to dereference
          a null pointer. One way to fix this is to initialize `david5` with a valid
          `data` pointer or add a check before dereferencing to see if the data is not
          null. For example:

          ```cpp
          if (adam1.b2->c2->d1->data != nullptr) {
              int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
              // Now you can safely use n
          } else {
              // Handle the case when data is nullptr
          }
          ```

          Make sure that `data` is set to some valid memory address if you intend to use
          it in this way. If it's valid for `data` to be `nullptr` in certain cases, your
          code must account for that possibility whenever you attempt to dereference it.

          (Message) The segmentation fault appears to be related to dereferencing a null
          or invalid pointer. Given the code provided, the likely culprit is one of the
          pointers within the chain of dereferences in the expression
          `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data`.

          Based on the backtrace and the code you've provided, the following objects are
          involved:
          - `adam1` of type `Adam`, which contains two pointers to `Bob` objects.
          - `b2` is a pointer to a `Bob` object within `Adam`.
          - `c2` is a pointer to a `Charlie` object within `Bob`.
          - `d1` is a pointer to a `David` object within `Charlie`.
          - `data` is a pointer to an `int` within `David`.

          The definitions provided show that:
          - `Adam` contains two pointers to `Bob` structs (`b1` and `b2`).
          - `Bob` contains pointers to `Charlie` structs (`c1` and `c2`) and to a `David`
          struct (`d2`).
          - `Charlie` contains a pointer to a `David` struct (`d1`).
          - `David` contains an `int` pointer (`data`).

          Considering the line `int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;`, we need to verify that
          each of the pointers (`b2`, `c2`, `d1`, `data`) is valid, particularly that they
          are not null since the fault address is `0x0`.

          The definition for the object `david5` reveals that it was initialized with a
          nullptr: `David david5 = {nullptr};`. If we trace that back:
          - `david5` is pointed to by `charlie4.d1`.
          - `charlie4` is pointed to by `bob2.c2`.
          - `bob2` is pointed to by `adam1.b2`.

          Therefore, in the problematic line of code, the dereferencing chain is following
          a path that includes `david5`, which was initialized with a null `data` pointer.
          Attempting to dereference this null pointer (`nullptr`) is what causes the
          segmentation fault.

          To fix the issue, ensure that a valid `int` pointer is assigned to `d1->data`
          inside the `David` struct that `adam1.b2->c2->d1` points to, before trying to
          dereference it. If you want `david5` to contain a valid `int` pointer, you could
          initialize it as follows:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {&arrayofints[some_valid_index]};
          ```

          Replace `some_valid_index` with an actual index value that is within the bounds
          of `arrayofints`.

          (Message) The `SIGSEGV` signal indicates a segmentation fault, which usually
          happens when the program tries to read or write an invalid memory location. In
          this case, the fault is at address `0x0`, which suggests a null pointer
          dereference.

          The problematic line is:
          ```
          40   int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```

          To understand what might be causing the segfault, let's examine each of the
          variables and their dereferences:

          1. `adam1` is an `Adam` structure with two fields: `b1` and `b2` of type `Bob*`
             Defined at line 38: `Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};`

          2. `b2` is a field of the `Adam` structure that refers to a `Bob` structure.
             Defined at line 19: `Bob *b2;`

          3. `c2` is a field of the `Bob` structure that refers to a `Charlie` structure.
             Defined at line 13: `Charlie *c2;`

          4. `d1` is a field of the `Charlie` structure that refers to a `David`
          structure.
             Defined at line 7: `David *d1;`

          5. `data` is a field of the `David` structure that refers to an `int*`.
             Defined at line 3: `int *data;`

          Given that the segfault address is `0x0`, we can identify the null pointer by
          looking at the chain of dereferences. The structure `David` with a field `data`
          is initialized twice without a null pointer at lines 32 (`David david4 =
          {&arrayofints[7]};`) and 34 (`David david6 = {&arrayofints[0]};`). However, a
          `David` structure with `data` initialized to `nullptr` is defined at line 33:
          `David david5 = {nullptr};`. This `nullptr` is being dereferenced, causing the
          segmentation fault.

          The `david5` pointer is being used to initialize `charlie4` at line 36:
          ```
          36   Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};
          ```
          And subsequently, `charlie4` is being used to initialize `bob2.c2` at line 37:
          ```
          37   Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6};
          ```
          Which is then used in `adam1.b2` at line 38.

          To fix the issue, ensure that `charlie4` is initialized with a valid `David`
          structure that has non-null `data`, or add a null check like below before
          attempting to dereference the `data` pointer:

          ```cpp
          if (adam1.b2->c2->d1->data != nullptr) {
              int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          } else {
              // Handle null data appropriately
          }
          ```

          Alternatively, if you meant to use a different `David` structure (one that
          doesn't have `data` set to `nullptr`), you would need to change the
          initialization of `charlie4` to point to the correct `David` instance.

          (Message) The SIGSEGV signal indicates a segmentation fault, which commonly
          happens when a program is trying to read or write an invalid memory location. In
          this case, it seems that the issue is related to dereferencing a pointer that
          may point to an invalid memory address.

          From the code given, the segmentation fault occurs at line 40 in `test-deep-
          recursion.cpp` while trying to dereference several pointers:
          ```cpp
          int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```

          The definition for the involved structures are as follows:
          - `Adam` contains two pointers to `Bob`, `b1` and `b2`.
          - `Bob` contains pointers to two `Charlie` instances, `c1` and `c2`, and one
          `David` instance, `d2`.
          - `Charlie` contains a pointer to `David`, `d1`.
          - `David` contains a pointer `data`.

          By sequentially dereferencing the pointers, we attempt to access an integer
          through a chain of pointer dereferences, where `Adam -> b2 -> Charlie -> c2 ->
          David -> d1 -> data`. If any of these pointers are `nullptr`, dereferencing it
          will cause a segmentation fault. Given the sequence, we need to ensure that each
          pointer in the chain is valid before dereferencing it.

          From the definitions above and the provided code snippet, we can see that
          `david5` is being created with a `nullptr` pointer:
          ```cpp
          David david5 = {nullptr};
          ```

          This `nullptr` is then used in the chain of dereferences through `charlie4` and
          subsequently `bob2`.
          ```cpp
          Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};
          Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6};
          Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};
          ```

          So when we try to access `data` through `adam1.b2->c2` (`bob2`), we are
          effectively trying to dereference a `nullptr`, which causes a segmentation
          fault.

          To fix the issue, we need to ensure that we are not initializing any `David`
          structs with a `nullptr` or add checks to safely handle such cases. For example,
          we can allocate an integer for `david5` or use another valid integer pointer
          already created.

          Here's one possible fix, assuming `arrayofints` is correctly allocated and has
          enough elements:

          ```cpp
          int valid_int_for_david5 = 42;
          David david5 = {&valid_int_for_david5};  // Changed from `nullptr` to a valid int pointer
          ```

          Or, if `arrayofints` is an array of sufficient size:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {&arrayofints[some_valid_index]};  // Use an existing value in the array
          ```

          In this case, you would replace `some_valid_index` with an index within the
          bounds of `arrayofints`.

          It's important to note that while fixing the immediate cause of the segmentation
          fault is necessary, it's also essential to ensure that this kind of error is
          handled throughout the codebase. For a more robust solution, you should
          implement checks where you verify pointer validity before dereferencing.

          (Message) The issue is that the code is attempting to dereference a pointer that
          is not pointing to a valid object. The `SIGSEGV` error indicates that the
          program is trying to access memory that it's not allowed to, which is commonly
          due to dereferencing a null or dangling pointer.

          Looking at the code, we can see that `adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` is being
          dereferenced at `test-deep-recursion.cpp:40`. To determine the cause of the null
          reference, we need to look at each pointer involved in this chain:

          1. `adam1`: An instance of the `Adam` struct, containing pointers to two `Bob`
          instances (`b1`, `b2`).
          2. `b2`: A member of `Adam`, which is a pointer to a `Bob` instance, initialized
          with `&bob2`.
          3. `c2`: A member of `Bob`, which is a pointer to a `Charlie` instance,
          initialized with `&charlie4`.
          4. `d1`: A member of `Charlie`, which is a pointer to a `David` instance,
          initialized with `&david5`.
          5. `data`: A member of `David`, which is a pointer to an `int`.

          From the definitions of the involved structs (`Adam`, `Bob`, `Charlie`, and
          `David`), and following the initialization, the only suspicious initialization
          seems to be:

          `David david5 = {nullptr};`

          This could be the cause if `charlie4.d1` is indeed initialized with `&david5`
          because following the chain would lead `adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` to attempt to
          dereference `nullptr`, which would result in a SIGSEGV.

          To fix the issue, make sure `David david5` is initialized with a valid `int`
          pointer rather than `nullptr`. If `nullptr` is an expected value, you would need
          to add a null check before dereferencing:

          ```cpp
          if (adam1.b2 && adam1.b2->c2 && adam1.b2->c2->d1 && adam1.b2->c2->d1->data) {
              int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
              // proceed with `n`
          }
          ```

          Check all other initializations to ensure that all pointers are properly
          assigned before being dereferenced.

          (Message) The issue occurs because the program tries to dereference a null
          pointer on the following line of code:

          ```cpp
          int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```

          After analyzing the definitions of the involved variables and structs:

          - `adam1` is an instance of the `Adam` struct, which contains two pointers to
          `Bob` structs: `b1` and `b2`.
          - `b2` is the second `Bob` pointer in the `Adam` struct.
          - `c2` is the second `Charlie` pointer in the `Bob` struct.
          - `d1` is a `David` pointer in the `Charlie` struct.
          - `data` is an `int` pointer in the `David` struct.

          From the code snippet:
          ```cpp
          37   Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6};
          38   Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};
          ```
          and the fact that the `SIGSEGV` is caused by trying to access memory at the
          address `0x0` (a null pointer), the member `d1` of `charlie4`, which is
          referenced by `adam1.b2->c2`, must be null because `charlie4` is initialized
          with `david5`, which in turn is initialized with `nullptr`:
          ```cpp
          33   David david5 = {nullptr};
          36   Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};
          ```

          To fix the issue, `david5` should be initialized with a valid `int` pointer
          instead of `nullptr`. Let's initialize `david5` to point to some valid integer
          in `arrayofints`. For example, we could make `david5` point to `arrayofints[5]`:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {&arrayofints[5]};
          ```

          This will prevent the null pointer dereference that is causing the segmentation
          fault.

          (Message) The program is crashing with a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) because it
          is trying to dereference a null pointer. Based on the line where the program
          stopped (`int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;` in `test-deep-recursion.cpp`), we
          can trace back the source of the null pointer.

          - The variable `b2` is a pointer to a `Bob` struct.
          - The variable `c2` is a pointer to a `Charlie` struct inside of the `Bob`
          struct.
          - The variable `d1` is a pointer to a `David` struct inside of the `Charlie`
          struct.
          - `data` is a pointer to an `int` inside of the `David` struct.

          Going backwards through the definitions:

          1. `data` is an `int*` within struct `David`.
          2. `d1` is a `David*` within struct `Charlie`.
          3. `c2` is a `Charlie*` within struct `Bob`.
          4. `b2` is a `Bob*` within struct `Adam`.

          The `David` struct being pointed to by `charlie4` (`charlie4` is referenced as
          `c2` in `bob2`, which in turn is referenced as `b2` in `adam1`) is `david5`,
          which in turn has its `data` field initialized with `nullptr` (as seen in the
          line `David david5 = {nullptr};`).

          To fix the issue, you need to ensure that `david5.data` is not a null pointer
          before trying to dereference it to get `n`.

          Here's a revised line of code with a null check added:

          ```cpp
          int n = 0;
          if (adam1.b2->c2->d1->data != nullptr){
              n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          }
          ```

          This code snippet will set `n` to the value of `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` if it
          is not a null pointer, avoiding the segmentation fault. However, you might also
          want to add appropriate error handling or logging to indicate that the `data`
          field was null, depending on the requirements of your application.

          (Message) The segmentation fault is being caused by trying to dereference a
          `nullptr`. The dereference happens in the expression `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data`
          on line 40. The definition of the `David` structure indicates that it has a
          member `int *data;`, and the creation of `David david5 = {nullptr};` on line 33
          sets `david5.data` to `nullptr`.

          In the construction of `charlie4` and `bob2`, `david5` is being used in a way
          that eventually leads to the dereference of the `nullptr` in the faulting line:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {nullptr};
          Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};
          Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6}; // This `charlie4` uses `david5` which has a `nullptr` `data` field
          Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};
          ```

          Therefore, dereferencing this null pointer with `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` causes
          the segmentation fault.

          To fix this issue, ensure that `david5` is properly initialized with a valid
          pointer before it is used. If `david5` should not be pointing to a valid `int`,
          then the code that leads to the dereference must be checked to prevent such a
          situation.

          Here is a possible code fix:

          ```cpp
          // Assuming arrayofints is correctly initialized and has enough elements
          David david5 = {&arrayofints[another_index]}; // Replace 'another_index' with a valid index
          ```

          Always ensure that you either:
          1. Initialize `David.data` with a valid pointer to an `int`, or,
          2. Add checks in the code to make sure you are not dereferencing a `nullptr`
          before accessing `data`.

          (Message) A segmentation fault, often referred to as a "segfault," is a specific
          kind of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong" to the program.
          When a program tries to read or write to an improper location, the operating
          system sends a signal to the program (specifically, signal `SIGSEGV`) indicating
          that an illegal memory access has been attempted, which typically results in the
          program being terminated.

          Segfaults can occur for a number of reasons, including:
          - Dereferencing `nullptr` pointers.
          - Accessing memory the program has not been allocated (or has been
          freed/deallocated).
          - Buffer overflows, where a program writes to memory beyond the bounds of
          allocated structures, arrays, etc.
          - Stack overflow, when too much stack memory is used, typically by deep or
          infinite recursion.

          In the context of debugging, a segfault signal is used to inform the debugger
          that the program has attempted to perform an illegal memory operation, usually
          resulting in the program being stopped for debugging or terminated if not being
          debugged.

          (Message) The `SIGSEGV` signal indicates a segmentation fault, which commonly
          occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that it's not allowed to
          access (for instance, a null pointer dereference).

          In your code, the segmentation fault occurs at line 40 when trying to
          dereference pointers to access an `int` value:
          ```cpp
          int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```
          The fault address `0x0` suggests that one of these pointers must be null (i.e.,
          pointing to address 0x0).

          Let's trace back the pointers based on the definitions found:

          - `adam1` is defined at line 38 and is of type `Adam` which contains two
          pointers to `Bob` structs: `(*b1, *b2)`.

          - `b2` is a member of the `Adam` struct and it holds a pointer to a `Bob`
          struct, as defined at line 19.

          - `c2` is a member of the `Bob` struct and it holds a pointer to a `Charlie`
          struct, as defined at line 13.

          - `d1` is a member of the `Charlie` struct and it holds a pointer to a `David`
          struct, as defined at line 7.

          - `data` is a member of the `David` struct and it is a pointer to an `int`, as
          defined at line 3.

          The `David` struct instance `david5`, which is initialized with a `nullptr` for
          the `data` member at line 33, is the likeliest source of the problem. As we can
          see, `charlie4` contains a pointer to `david5` (at line 36), and that reference
          is used to initialize `b2` (at line 37) as `c2`. Thus, `adam1.b2->c2->d1->data`
          is trying to dereference a `nullptr`, which leads to the segmentation fault.

          To fix this issue, ensure that no null pointer is dereferenced. You could, for
          example, initialize `david5` with a valid memory address or add checks that
          validate pointers before dereferencing them. Here is a potential fix:
          ```cpp
          David david5 = {&arrayofints[1]}; // Assuming arrayofints has at least 2 elements.
          ```

          Or, if modifying the initializers is not an option, you could add runtime
          checks:
          ```cpp
          if (adam1.b2 && adam1.b2->c2 && adam1.b2->c2->d1 && adam1.b2->c2->d1->data)
          {
              int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          }
          else
          {
              // Handle the null pointer scenario appropriately.
          }
          ```
          Make sure `arrayofints` has enough elements to prevent going out of bounds if
          you choose to reference an element from it.

          (Message) The crash signal `SIGSEGV` at the address `0x0` indicates that there
          is a dereference of a null pointer. Specifically, in frame #0, the `data` member
          of a `David` struct is being dereferenced. Looking at the code:

          ```cpp
          int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```

          The code is attempting to access `data` through a series of pointer dereferences
          starting from an `Adam` instance `adam1`. To determine which of these
          dereferences are valid and which might be leading to a null pointer, we will
          need to look at how these structures and data are initialized in the source
          code.

          The definitions of the structs, `Adam`, `Bob`, `Charlie`, and `David`, show that
          there is a chain of pointers from `Adam` to `Bob`, then to `Charlie`, and
          finally to `David`, which contains an `int* data`; the issue seems to lie within
          this chain.

          To fix this issue, we need to ensure that none of the pointers in this chain are
          null when they are being dereferenced. Specifically, this means checking the
          construction of `adam1`, and especially its members `b2`, `c2`, `d1`, as well as
          the `data` within the corresponding `David` struct that should point to an
          `int`.

          Based on the `signal SIGSEGV` and the information that the fault address is
          `0x0`, it is highly likely that `d1->data` is null in the `Charlie` structure
          pointed to by `adam1.b2->c2`. This implies that `david5`'s `data` member is
          likely null, as `david5` is the only `David` struct initialized with `nullptr`:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {nullptr};
          ```

          So, when `adam1.b2->c2` points to `charlie4`, which contains `&david5`,
          dereferencing `d1->data` leads to a null pointer dereference.

          To ensure that the `data` pointer in `David` is not null, each `David` instance
          must be initialized with a valid `int*`. In this case, you can assign a valid
          address to `david5`'s `data` member during its initialization. If `arrayofints`
          is expected to hold valid data, you could initialize `david5` like this:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {&arrayofints[/* valid index */]};
          ```

          Remember to replace `/* valid index */` with an index that is within the bounds
          of `arrayofints`.

          It would also be useful to add null checks to prevent dereferencing nullptr if
          there is a possibility of any member being null at runtime.

          (Message) The SIGSEGV signal indicates that the program is making an invalid
          memory reference, which is commonly due to dereferencing a null pointer. Let's
          break down the problematic line of code:

          ```cpp
          int n = *adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```

          To dereference and obtain `n`, the following chain of pointers is traversed:

          - `adam1.b2` refers to the `b2` member of `Adam`, which is of type `Bob*`.
          - `b2->c2` refers to the `c2` member of `Bob`, which is of type `Charlie*`.
          - `c2->d1` refers to the `d1` member of `Charlie`, which is of type `David*`.
          - `d1->data` refers to the `data` member of `David`, which is of type `int*`.

          From the definitions and the line where the segmentation fault occurs, we know
          that we are ultimately trying to dereference an integer pointer to assign its
          value to `n`. However, because the address is `0x0` (which represents a null
          pointer), we are likely trying to dereference a null pointer somewhere in this
          chain.

          Examining the structs' definitions and the line where the fault occurs, we
          observe that `david5` is initialized with a `nullptr` for its `data` field:

          ```cpp
          33   David david5 = {nullptr};
          ```

          It is then used to initialize `charlie4`:

          ```cpp
          36   Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};
          ```

          And `charlie4` is referenced by `bob2`:

          ```cpp
          37   Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6};
          ```

          Finally, `bob2` is assigned to `adam1.b2`:

          ```cpp
          38   Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};
          ```

          Therefore, on the line causing the segmentation fault, we are attempting to
          deference the null pointer in `david5.data` through `adam1.b2->c2->d1->data`.

          To fix the issue, `david5.data` should not be a null pointer. It should be
          assigned a valid memory address pointing to an integer. If `david5` should not
          refer to an existing integer, then it could be initialized with a dynamically
          allocated integer, like so:

          ```cpp
          // Somewhere before it's used:
          int* ptr = new int(42); // Assuming we want to assign the value 42 to the location.
          David david5 = {ptr};

          // Ensure to delete the allocated memory before the program exits to avoid a memory leak:
          delete ptr;
          ```

          Alternatively, if `david5` is not meant to contain any meaningful data, then the
          code should check for `nullptr` before attempting to dereference `data`,
          preventing the error from occurring. It's important to determine the correct
          logic based on the program's requirements.

          (Message) From the information provided, I can see that there is a segmentation
          fault occurring at line 40 in the file `test-deep-recursion.cpp`. This suggests
          a dereferencing of a null pointer or an invalid memory access. To understand the
          root of the issue, it is necessary to look into the structure hierarchy of
          `Adam`, `Bob`, `Charlie`, and `David` where the segmentation fault is
          originating.

          The definitions of the structures are as follows:

          - `Adam` (line 16):
          ```cpp
            struct Adam
            {
              Bob *b1;
              Bob *b2;
            };
            ```

          - `Bob` (line 9):
          ```cpp
            struct Bob
            {
              Charlie *c1;
              Charlie *c2;
              David *d2;
            };
            ```

          - `Charlie` (line 5):
          ```cpp
            struct Charlie
            {
              David *d1;
            };
            ```

          - `David` (line 1):
          ```cpp
            struct David
            {
              int *data;
            };
            ```

          However, the structure `David` has an int pointer named `data` - this is crucial
          because if this pointer is null, dereferencing it would cause a segmentation
          fault.

          In your code, you are trying to dereference `adam1.b2->c2->d1->data`. To do this
          safely, each of these pointers (`b2`, `c2`, `d1`, `data`) must be non-null. The
          segmentation fault suggests that at least one of them is null.

          Looking at the initialization of the structures, `david5` is initialized with
          nullptr:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {nullptr};
          ```

          This is then used to initialize `charlie4`:

          ```cpp
          Charlie charlie4 = {&david5};
          ```

          Following the object hierarchy, `charlie4` is then assigned to `bob2.c2`:

          ```cpp
          Bob bob2 = {&charlie3, &charlie4, &david6};
          ```

          And `bob2` is referenced in `adam1.b2`:

          ```cpp
          Adam adam1 = {&bob1, &bob2};
          ```

          `adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` leads to `david5.data`, which is `nullptr`, and hence
          the dereferencing operation `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` fails with a segmentation
          fault.

          To fix this issue, you need to ensure that `david5.data` is assigned a valid
          memory address or that your code includes checks to prevent dereferencing a null
          pointer:

          ```cpp
          David david5 = {new int(42)};

          // ... (rest of the code)

          // Remember to delete the dynamically allocated memory at the appropriate time
          delete adam1.b2->c2->d1->data;
          ```

          Alternatively, if dynamic memory allocation is not required, you can simply use
          an existing int variable or static allocation to avoid nullptr:

          ```cpp
          int someValue = 42;
          David david5 = {&someValue}; // Use an address of an existing int
          ```

          Remember to ensure that the memory you are pointing to is valid and exists for
          as long as you are using the `data` pointer within the structs.

          (Message) The issue in your code is with the access of the pointers in the
          expression `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data` at line 40. The issue lies with the symbol
          `adam1` which seems to be incorrectly accessed.

          The correct way to access the data would be as follows:
          Instead of `*adam1.b2->c2->d1->data`, you should use
          `*adam1.b2->charlie2->david1->data` assuming the correct structure of your
          objects.

          To access the correct pointer, the code needs to be updated as follows:
          ```cpp
          int n = *adam1.b2->charlie2->david1->data;
          ```

          This change ensures that you are correctly following the structure of the
          objects and accessing the data in a valid manner.
