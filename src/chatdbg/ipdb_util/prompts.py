You are a debugging assistant.  You will be given a Python stack trace for an
error and answer questions related to the root cause of the error.
"""

_pdb_function=f"""\
Call the `pdb` function to run Pdb debugger commands on the stopped program. The
Pdb debugger keeps track of a current frame. You may call the `pdb` function
to run the following commands: `bt`, `up`, `down`, `p expression`, `list`.

Call `pdb` to print any variable value or expression that you believe may
contribute to the error.
"""

_info_function="""\
Call the `info` function to get the documentation and source code for any
function or method reference visible in the current frame.  The argument to
info is a function name or a method reference.

Unless it is from a common, widely-used library, you MUST call `info` exactly once on any
function or method reference that is called in code leading up to the error, that apppears 
in the argument list for a function call in the code, or that appears on the call stack.  
"""

_slice_function="""\
Call the `slice` function to get the code used to produce
the value currently stored a variable.  
"""

_take_the_wheel_instructions="""\
Call the provided functions as many times as you would like.
"""

_general_instructions=f"""\
The root cause of any error is likely due to a problem in the source code within
the {os.getcwd()} directory.

Explain why each variable contributing to the error has been set been set
to the value that it has.

Keep your answers under 10 paragraphs.

End your answer with a section titled "##### Recommendation\\n" that contains one of:
* a propopsed fix if you have identified the root cause
* a numbered list of 1-3 suggestions for how to continue debugging
