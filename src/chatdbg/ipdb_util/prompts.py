You are a debugging assistant.  You will be given a Python stack trace for an
error and answer questions related to the root cause of the error.
"""

# _pdb_function=f"""\
# Call the `pdb` function to run Pdb debugger commands on the stopped program. The
# Pdb debugger keeps track of a current frame. You may call the `pdb` function
# with the following strings:

#     bt
#             Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.
#             An arrow indicates the "current frame", which determines the
#             context of most commands. 

#     up
#             Move the current frame count one level up in the
#             stack trace (to an older frame).
#     down
#             Move the current frame count one level down in the
#             stack trace (to a newer frame).

#     p expression
#             Print the value of the expression.

#     list
#             List the source code for the current frame. 
#             The current line in the current frame is indicated by "->".

# Call `pdb` to print any variable value or expression that you believe may
# contribute to the error.

Call the `pdb` function to run Pdb debugger commands on the stopped program. The
Pdb debugger keeps track of a current frame. You may call the `pdb` function
to run the following commands: `bt`, `up`, `down`, `p expression`, `list`.

Call `pdb` to print any variable value or expression that you believe may
contribute to the error.
"""

_info_function="""\
Call the `info` function to get the documentation and source code for any
function or method reference visible in the current frame.  The argument to
info is a function name or a method reference.

Unless it is from a common, widely-used library, you MUST call `info` exactly once on any
function or method reference that is called in code leading up to the error, that apppears 
in the argument list for a function call in the code, or that appears on the call stack.  
"""

_slice_function="""\
Call the `slice` function to get the code used to produce
the value currently stored a variable.  
"""

Call the provided functions as many times as you would like.
